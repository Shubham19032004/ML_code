# Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to the "Machine Learning from Scratch" repository! Here, I share my implementations of machine learning algorithms written from scratch. These implementations are designed to help you understand the underlying concepts of various machine learning models and techniques.

## Introduction

In this repository, I explore and implement machine learning algorithms without relying on external libraries. The goal is to provide clear and concise code that serves as a learning resource for those who want to dive into the internals of machine learning.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. [Gradient Descent](/GradientDescent): Implementation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm.
2. [Multiple Linear Regression](/MultiLinear): Implementation of multiple linear regression from scratch.
3. [Linear Regression](/linearRegression): Implementation of simple linear regression.

(Add more sections based on the algorithms you've implemented)

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its respective directory. You can explore the code and documentation within each directory to understand the implementation details.

To run a specific algorithm, follow the instructions provided in the respective README or Jupyter Notebook within the algorithm's directory.

## Requirements

The implementations are mostly written in Python. You may need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.x)
- (Add any additional dependencies based on your implementations)

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
